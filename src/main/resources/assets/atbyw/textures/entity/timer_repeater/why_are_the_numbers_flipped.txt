I had to flip the number sprites upside down, 
because for SOME FUCKING REASON, Mojang's blockentity rendering system flips them upside down.
It was the easiest way to get the numbers to render rightside up, sorry about that.

If you have a solution to this problem, that could allow me to put the numbers rightside up in the textures,
please feel free to open a ticke at : https://github.com/Azagwen/ATBYW/issues

this is clearly a major, game-breaking issue that needs to be fixed for the good of humanity !
