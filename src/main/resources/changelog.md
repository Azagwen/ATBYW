##Details on the new Blocks

###Statues
13 Statues representing almost every "small" mob in MC have been added.
Statues will gain moss over time and can be scraped once they reach their maximum moss level
Scraping a Statue's moss on maximum level has a chance of dropping an item, the item in question
corresponding to the mob the statue represents.
This can be used to farm mob loots without building complex farms.

Each Statue can also be waxed, freezing its current moss state in place.
Bigger statues are planned for later, but for now, I hope you will enjoy these !

###Shroomstick
The Shroomstick is a block that emits lights, very much like torches.

The Shroomstick item can be thrown around in the world, it will bounce off of the ground and walls a few times before
placing itselfas a block in your world, if the block it lands on is not full it will simply drop down allowing you to
collect it back and throw it again !
It also emits dynamic lighting when thrown thanks to the LambDynamicLights API.

If you don't feel like throwing it, it can also simply be placed down by aiming at a block.

###Compacted Snow
Compacted snow is a new snow layer variant, it doesn't melt and therefore can be used around light sources or even lava.
It also drops itself, unlike normal snow layers.

###Redstone Lantern
Redstone lanterns are special lanterns that emit redstone power. They can be right clicked to change
the intensity of the power they will output, making them useful for comparator based systems.
They can also be powered off, and burn out like redstone torches.

###Redstone Jack'o Lantern
Redstone Jack'o Lantern are just like regular Jack'o Lantern, except they will output a redstone signal of 15 from their face.
They can be used to output a signal from only one direction, they can also be powered off.

###Spike Traps
Spike traps are a new trap redstone component, they deal damage when activated and will also slow you down and give you a
slight minining fatigue effect, making it a rather deadly trap to fall in. Spike traps can also break the block above them when
activated, higher levels of spike traps can break more tough blocks, but blocks like obsidian and netherite blocks cannot be
broken by them, even by a diamond or netherite spike trap as spike traps are not as powerful as pickaxes.

Timer Repeater
The Timer Repeater is almost like a regular a repeater, except it can count up to 64 before activating/deactivating.
It can be used ot avoid using large numbers of repeaters in some situations.

###Redstone Cross
The Redstone Cross is a rather simple redstone component, it allows two redstone paths to cross eachother with no interference.
Making it useful in tight spaces where you need two paths to cross but don't have the space.
Note however that it doesn't work with itself as of now due to a bug, its a, it works perfectly fine with almost all redstone components still.

##World Generation
Structures have been added to ATBYW!
They use blocks the mod adds in all their glory.

- Added Big Igloo
- Added Ice Spike Base
- Added Desert Crypt
- Added Savana Mineshaft
- Added Mesa Tomb

#Version Updating guidelines

`R.V.P`
```
R = Release
V = Version
P = Patch
```

###Release
Release will most likely never increase, it would only go up if a completely new release of the mod (re-imagined, or similar) came out.

###Version
Version goes up either when a new major update of the mod is released, or when the mod is updated to a new Minecraft version.

###Patch
Patch goes up when a small update is released, such a bug fix or an update that doesn't add much.
